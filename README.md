## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🏭 Tennessee Eastman Process Fault Diagnosis (Industrial ML)(https://[github.com/NforcheDivine/Customer-Churn-Prediction-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project](https://github.com/NforcheDivine/TEP-Fault-Diagnosis-ML))
End-to-end industrial machine learning pipeline for multi-class fault diagnosis using time-series feature engineering, leakage-safe validation, and Random Forest classification. Improved Macro F1 from **0.74 → 0.95** through temporal engineering and robust evaluation.


### 🎯 [Clinical Data Quality Pipeline (MSc Thesis)]
Designed and implemented a semi-automated ETL pipeline to monitor data quality in a longitudinal sarcopenia study (250+ participants). Focused on metadata tracking, forensic validation, and reproducibility across survey and lab data streams.

### 💡 [Customer Churn Prediction (Lloyds Bank Dataset)](https://github.com/NforcheDivine/Customer-Churn-Prediction-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project)
End-to-end ML project using logistic regression and scikit-learn pipelines to predict customer churn. Includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and improvement strategies.

### 📈 [YouTube Analytics ETL API](https://github.com/NforcheDivine/youtube-analytics-etl-api)
Lightweight REST API and ETL pipeline built in Python to ingest and analyze YouTube channel analytics data.
